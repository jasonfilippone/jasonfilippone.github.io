<h1> About Me</h1>
        <p> Hello, My name is Jason Filippone. I am a freshman here at the University of Rhode Island and I live in Hillside Hall. 
     My major is Computer Science and I plan on minoring in either digital forensics or cybersecurity. I am from Cranston, Rhode Island, which is only around 35 minutes away from campus. 
     I come from an Italian family and I have two older siblings. In my free time I love to watch any Boston sports team 
     and play sports, but baseball is my favorite.  I played baseball my whole life until I turned into a middle school baseball coach 
     the past two seasons. When I am not coaching, I enjoy fishing with my friends and spending time 
            with my family.</p>

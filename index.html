<h1> Welcome to Jason's Programming Portfolio! </h1>
        
<p> Hello, My name is Jason Filippone. I created this website to showcase the work that I have done over the course of this class.
    The class that I am taking is called CSC 106: The Joy of Programming. In this class, I am taught the basics of programming.
    I developed this website using only HTML programming language.  In the pages Javascript and Apps, you will see all of the 
    work that I did in the class. I hope you enjoy the work that I am showcasing. </p>

<h1> Welcome to My Final Project Page! Enjoy Our Game!</h1>
 <div class="textwidth">       
<p> For my Computer Science 106 final project, my partner and me decided to make a version of “Flappy Bird,” but different 
    in some ways.  We decided on naming our game “Flappy Moji.”  Our game allows for users to decide what character they 
    would like to use for the game.  The characters that a user can choose from are my partner’s bitmoji or my bitmoji that 
    we created earlier on in this course.  Once the user decides and selects on what character they would like to use, they 
    will be brought right to the gameplay scene.  The user will notice how our game that we created is similar to the well 
    known “Flappy Bird,” but there are many other rules that make our game unique.  To make the character move up and down,
    the user should use the spacebar on the keyboard.  Gems are placed in between the walls and the user is encouraged to 
    collect the gems.  If the user collects a gem, one point will be added to the score.  However, if the user comes in 
    contact with a wall, the user will lose one point from the score.  The game will end when the user’s score reaches -5.  
    So, the user has many lives before the game is over.  Now, it is time to play our game below.  My partner and I hope you 
    enjoy the game and survive as long as you can!</p> </div>
